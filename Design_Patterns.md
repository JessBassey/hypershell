# Introduction #

Hypershell is not exactly a brand new concept. I draw inspiration from many emerging design patterns in web applications, which eventually lead me to the idea of Hypershell.

What I do is basically try to find a unified way to implement these design patterns using HTTP, and Hypershell is the result of such implementation


# Design Patterns #

## REST - Representational State Transfer ##


## HTTP API ##


## Middleware ##


## HTTP Cache ##


## Unix Shell ##
