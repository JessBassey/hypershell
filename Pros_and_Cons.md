A web application written following the programming paradigm of Hypershell enjoys many benefits over traditional web applications:

## Unified Interface Design ##
Hypershellâ€™s P2P HTTP approach greatly simplifies the complexity of web application design: developer can simply design a unified HTTP API to serve Ajax applications, web mashups, other websites, as well as other internal components.

## Flexible ##
Hypershell also makes a web application more flexible: it decouples different components in a system and allows developers to replace the implementation of one component easily without affecting other components. In typical MVC design pattern, this implies that one can, for example, replace the View with a completely different templating and theming system without requiring modification on the Model and the Controller subsystem.

## Scalable ##
A Hypershell command can either be located on the same local server, or on an Intranet peer server, or on an external website. However it does not matter to a Hypershell consumer that initiates the HTTP request. Using the Hypershell virtual URI system, administrator can transparently move a resource intensive Hypershell command to another server. This allows different components to scale independently out of the box.

## Portable ##
Thanks to the nature of HTTP, Hypershell applications are portable and deployable to servers out of the box. Whenever there is a need for native low level functionality, developer can always wrap that native library into a Hypershell command and deploy it manually on a separate server in a cluster. Other servers in the cluster can then simply initiate HTTP requests to the server containing the native Hypershell command. Scripts portability reduces the administration overhead of installing and managing custom native applications to every server in a cluster, and provides a simple solution to cluster management.
